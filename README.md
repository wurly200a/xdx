# xdx
XDX is a sound editor of YAMAHA 4 operators / 6 operators FM sound source synthesizer DX7(/TX7), DX100(/DX27/DX21).  It works on Windows. Windows7 32bit / Windows 8 32bit / Windows 10 64bit operation verification is done.  (Editing sounds is possible with only software, but when you actually use sounds, the instrument itself and the MIDI I / F are necessary)  Although it is free software, I am seeking donations.
